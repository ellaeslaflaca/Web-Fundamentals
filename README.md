# Web-Fundamentals

You found your way to my first bootcamp coursework! 

Here I am learning the basics of front-end development by building my first projects using HTML, CSS, and Javascript! 

As I move forward with assignments and strengthen my skills, I will be going back and fixing and/or updating previous projects.
